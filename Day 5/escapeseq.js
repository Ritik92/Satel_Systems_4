// Escape sequence characters are special characters in strings that perform specific actions.
// They always start with a backslash (\) to indicate a special meaning.

// Here are some basic escape sequences with examples:

// 1. \n - Newline: Moves the text to a new line.
console.log("Hello\nWorld"); // Output:
// Hello
// World

// 2. \t - Tab: Adds a horizontal tab space.
console.log("Hello\tWorld"); // Output: Hello    World (with extra space between Hello and World)

// 3. \\ - Backslash: Prints a single backslash.
console.log("This is a backslash: \\"); // Output: This is a backslash: \

// 4. \" - Double Quote: Allows double quotes inside a string enclosed by double quotes.
console.log("She said, \"Hello!\""); // Output: She said, "Hello!"

// 5. \' - Single Quote: Allows single quotes inside a string enclosed by single quotes.
console.log('It\'s a sunny day!'); // Output: It's a sunny day!


// Escape sequences help format strings, manage special characters, and improve readability of complex outputs.
